# Introduction to CSS Grid: What You Should Know

## Abstract

When it comes to building responsive web layouts we’ve used tables, floats and Flexbox. Now there’s CSS Grid and it's completely changing the way we should think about layouts. In this talk, we’ll go over the basics of Grid and what differentiates it from other techniques. Through code examples and demos, you’ll walk out of this talk able to start using Grid right away.

## Notes

I really aimed for this talk to use easy, beginner-friendly terms so anyone can walk in and understand how to work with Grid. Grid is really changing the way we as developers and designers should think about layouts as well as making the sites we build more accessible. That's something I am really passionate about showing in this talk.
