## Current Bio
Kara Luton went from tutus to tech. After pursuing a career as a professional ballerina, Kara returned to her hometown of Nashville, TN to work as a music publicist. A life of pitching journalists and red carpets left her feeling unfulfilled and she switched to the tech field. Now she has a passion for introducing other women to this industry and showing them that they can succeed. 

Outside of work, Kara co-organizes the Nashville chapter of Tech Ladies. She also enjoys playing with her golden retriever mix, going to concerts and seeing a ballet whenever she can.
