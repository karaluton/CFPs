# From Tutus To Tech: Looking Back on Transitioning Careers (Twice!)

## Abstract

What do ballet, music publicity and front end engineering have in common? More than you would think. Three years ago I didn’t know what a div was but I did know I needed a career change. I stumbled upon the tech world, enrolled in a bootcamp and haven’t looked back. 

Non-traditional paths are becoming more common place in the tech industry. There are more bootcamp and self-taught devs than ever before. In this talk, we’ll discuss what it was like for me to transition to tech from not one, but two completely unrelated careers, how I bring my past experiences into my current role and why you should consider hiring more devs with non-traditional backgrounds.
